                Hi, I am dan. I am a person in recovery who enjoys technology and everything about it. I played with
                tech when I was younger (like everyone else) and then I grew up and got my B.S in Computer Science!
                Next, I went and got a Master’s in Cyber Security. Now, I am studying up on a lifelong passion, art.
                When I say art, I mean graphic design! Addiction is something I am familiar with and recovery is
                something I am passionate about. This website was born out of the need to put together a website which
                doesn’t prioritize charging people an insane amount of money for 30 day treatment or spam people with
                absurd ads. Everyone should have access to free resources and it should be aesthetically pleasing to a
                certain extent.
